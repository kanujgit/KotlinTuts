/**
 * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-bigdecimal/problem
 * Java's BigDecimal class can handle arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. Let's test your knowledge of them!
 * <p>
 * Given an array, , of  real number strings, sort them in descending order â€” but wait, there's more! Each number must be printed in the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that  is printed as , and  is printed as . If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values (e.g., ), then they must be listed in the same order as they were received as input).
 * <p>
 * Complete the code in the unlocked section of the editor below. You must rearrange array 's elements according to the instructions above.
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * <p>
 * The first line consists of a single integer, , denoting the number of integer strings.
 * Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a real number denoting the value of .
 * <p>
 * Constraints
 * <p>
 * Each  has at most  digits.
 * Output Format
 * <p>
 * Locked stub code in the editor will print the contents of array  to stdout. You are only responsible for reordering the array's elements.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * <p>
 * 9
 * -100
 * 50
 * 0
 * 56.6
 * 90
 * 0.12
 * .12
 * 02.34
 * 000.000
 * Sample Output
 * <p>
 * 90
 * 56.6
 * 50
 * 02.34
 * 0.12
 * .12
 * 0
 * 000.000
 * -100
